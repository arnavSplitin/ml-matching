## Data Preprocessing and Exploration

The initial phase focused on preparing the dataset, which included features such as age, lifestyle choices, personal interests, and location preferences.

- **Handling Missing Values**
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Utilizing OneHotEncoder for categorical data to transform it into a format that is suitable for input in machine learning models.
- **Feature Scaling**: Standardizing numerical features to bring them onto a comparable scale.


## Machine Learning Models for Roommate Matching

#### K-Means Clustering

The primary approach involved K-Means clustering. The model aimed to cluster individuals based on similarities across their features, theoretically grouping potential roommates with compatible preferences and lifestyles.

#### Alternatives Explored

Several alternative models were explored to enhance the matching process:

- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Used for its feature to reveal intricate structures within the data without predetermining the number of clusters.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Considered for leveraging similarity in user preferences, as it is used in recommendation systems.
- **Dimensionality Reduction + Clustering**: PCA and t-SNE were used to reduce feature space complexity and it potentially improves clustering results.
- **Siamese Neural Network**: A deep learning approach designed to learn a similarity metric between pairs of user profiles, offering a more detailed and advanced method for matching. 



## Pivoting to Apartment Matching

- **Feature Reconfiguration**: The dataset must be restructured to include apartment-specific features (e.g., rent price, location, amenities), in addition to renter preferences. This adjustment also means that feature selection and engineering needs to be reevaluated so as to avoid any errors.

- **Model Adjustment**: Unlike roommate matching's many-to-many context, apartment matching will be one-to-many (renter to apartments). To adapt our codebase we will have to modify the approaches slightly as I outline below.


### Clustering Renters Based on Preferences

**Applying Clustering Algorithms**: Utilize clustering algorithms, such as K-Means, hierarchical clustering, or DBSCAN, to group renters into clusters based on their similarities in preferences. The choice of algorithm can depend on the dataset's size and complexity, and the granularity of clusters.


### Clustering Apartments Based on Features

**Clustering Apartments**: Apply clustering techniques to categorize apartments into groups that share similar attributes. This process can help in identifying distinct types of rental properties that cater to different renter segments.

### Matching Renters with Apartments

- **Cross-Cluster Matching**: Once both renters and apartments are clustered, the matching process can involve identifying compatible renter and apartment clusters. This might be based on the proximity of cluster centers in the feature space or matching cluster labels if the clusters are formed based on similar criteria.

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Within compatible clusters, we can further personalize apartment recommendations for each renter by considering their unique preferences and the specific attributes of apartments within the targeted cluster. This can involve ranking apartments based on how well they match an individual renter's preferences.


### Deep Learning Model 

- **Utilizing Siamese Neural Networks for Renters and Apartments**: Adapting the Siamese Neural Network to generate embeddings for both renters and apartments requires generating and labeling renter-apartment pairs.
